## Usage

### Installation

> **Note:** Since this project is currently in active development, there is no installer (`.msi` or setup `.exe`) yet. To set up the application permanently (Start Menu icon, Autostart), please follow the manual steps below.

1. **Download** the latest `razer-battery-report.exe` from [Releases](https://github.com/xzeldon/razer-battery-report/releases/latest).

2. **Move the executable** to a safe permanent location.
   - _Recommended:_ Create a folder at `C:\Program Files\Razer Battery Report\` and move the `.exe` there.
   - _Note:_ This prevents accidental deletion from your Downloads folder.

3. **Add to Startup** (Recommended):
   - Right-click `razer-battery-report.exe` -> **Create shortcut**.
   - Press `Win + R`, type `shell:startup` and press Enter.
   - Move the created shortcut into the opened folder.
   - _Now the app will start automatically when you log in._

4. **Add to Start Menu** (Optional):
   - Create another shortcut.
   - Press `Win + R`, type `shell:programs` and press Enter.
   - Move the shortcut into the opened folder.
   - _Now you can search for "Razer Battery Report" in Windows Search._

> **Tips:**
>
> - You can rename the shortcuts to simply **"Razer Battery Report"** (remove ".exe" and "Shortcut").
> - **Custom Icon:**
>   1. Download [`mouse.ico`](https://github.com/xzeldon/razer-battery-report/raw/master/assets/mouse.ico) (save it in the same folder as the `.exe`).
>   2. Right-click the shortcut -> **Properties** -> **Change Icon...** -> **Browse** -> Select the downloaded `.ico` file.

### Building from Source

To build, you must have [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and
[Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed on your system.

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/xzeldon/razer-battery-report.git`
2. Navigate into your local repository: `cd razer-battery-report`
3. Build: `cargo build --release`
4. Executable will be located at `target/release/razer-battery-report.exe`

## Adding new devices yourself

- add device with `name`, `pid`, `interface`, `usage_page`, `usage` to [devices.rs](/src/devices.rs)
- add `transaction_id` to switch statement in `DeviceInfo` in [devices.rs](/src/devices.rs)

> You can grab `pid` and other data from the [openrazer](https://github.com/openrazer/openrazer/blob/685290bb0128dc0b063c524b55f76f4091da9b15/driver/razermouse_driver.h)

## Todo

- [x] Tray Applet
  - [ ] Force update devices button in tray menu
